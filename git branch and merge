can have more than one branch.
-Every branch has its own copy of the project history and develops on its own code.
They are easily and often merged with each other.
- it does not effect the main branch (master) 

GIT BRANCH AND MERGE

example:
1. create git folder (ex: ina-test-repo-2) and  add file name mahasiswa.html - refer readme example on ina-test-repo folder
2. CREATE BRANCH (branch : dosen and staf)
        
                1- $ git branch dosen
                2- $ git branch staff
3. check branch name and which branch is active (current active branch is master, with star indicator *)

                3- $ git branch
                    dosen
                  * master
                    staff
4. go to dosen branch 
                
                4- $ git checkout dosen
                5- $ git branch
                   * dosen
                     master
                     staff
                    
5. currently we are on dosen branch (create new file name dosen.html and add into the dosen branch then commit)

                6- $ git add .
                7- $ git commit -m "menambah file dosen.html"
6. view network graph (new commit on dosen branch)

                8- $ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
                    * 4d630df (HEAD -> dosen) menambahkan file dosen.html
                    * 47de190 (staff, master) menambah 1 data mahasiswa
                    * 260e41f menambahkan file mahasiswa.html
                    
 7. add commit for staff branch (add new file name staff.html)
                9- $ git checkout staff (go to staff branch)
               10- $ git status (check status file)
                   On branch staff
                    Untracked files:
                      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
                            staff.html

                    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
                    
                 11- $ git add. (add all file)
                 12- $ git commit -m "menambahkan file staff.html"
                       [staff 6d32aca] Menambahkan file staff.html
                       1 file changed, 18 insertions(+)
                       create mode 100644 staff.html
8. view current graph (currently we are on staff branch so HEAD point to staff)
                
                13- $ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

                    * 6d32aca (HEAD -> staff) Menambahkan file staff.html
                    | * 4d630df (dosen) menambahkan file dosen.html
                    |/
                    * 47de190 (master) menambah 1 data mahasiswa
                    * 260e41f menambahkan file mahasiswa.html
                    
------this graph shows that staff and dosen branch have direct path with the master-------
                     
MERGE : there is 2 type of merge
        - FAST FORWARD : the branch has direct path from master 
        - THREE-WAY MERGE : do not have direct path from master

9. FAST FORWARD MERGE : merge dosen branch to master

                 14- $ git checkout master (back to master branch)
                     Switched to branch 'master'
                 15- $ git merge dosen
                      Updating 47de190..4d630df
                      Fast-forward

                      create mode 100644 dosen.html
10. delete dosen branch (because we have merge it into master)
                  
                  16- $ git branch --merged (shows which branch that have been merged)
                       dosen
                     * master
                     
                  17- $ git branch -d dosen (delete branch dosen)
                        Deleted branch dosen (was 4d630df).
                  
                  18- $ git branch (make sure dosen branch deleted, only staff branch appear)
                       * master
                         staff
11. THREE-WAY MERGE / MERGE COMMIT : do not have direct path with the master
                     
                    19- $ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
